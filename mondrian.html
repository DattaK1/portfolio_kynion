                <b>Composition C (No.III) with Red, Yellow and Blue (1935) </b> <br> <br> Piet Mondrian is a Dutch artist best known for his abstract paintings. Art that is abstract does not show things that are recognisable such as people, objects or landscapes. Instead artists use colours, shapes and textures to achieve their effect. When Mondrian made his paintings, he would always mix his own colours, never using the paint directly out of a tube. He often used primary colours – red yellow and blue – as in this painting.  <br> <br> <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/piet-mondrian-1651/mondrian-guide-life">Painting Source</a> <br> <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/kids/explore/who-is/who-piet-mondrian">Description Source</a>
